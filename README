A quick and dirty tool for generating a newline-separated list
of IP addresses given either a minimum and maximum address or a
CIDR string. I couldn't find a tool that did exactly this, and
I found myself needing something that did do exactly this a few
different times, while writing various bash scripts. So, here it
is. I hope it comes in handy.
