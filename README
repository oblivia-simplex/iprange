A quick and dirty tool for generating a newline-separated** list
of IP addresses given either a minimum and maximum address or a
CIDR string. I couldn't find a tool that did exactly this, and
I found myself needing something that did do exactly this a few
different times, while writing various bash scripts.* So, here it
is. I hope it comes in handy. 

* The idea is that it should be handy for doing things like this,
  in bash, or the scripting lang of your choice:

  for ip in `iprange 192.168.2.0/16`; do
    something_or_other $ip
  done

** I plan to allow for other separators as well, controlled with some
   cli parameter or other. But for now, piping into tr works fine. 
   To get a comma-separated list, e.g., just use 
          iprange 192.168.2.0/16 | tr \\n , | sed s/,$//
   (and add another backslash to \\n if you're enclosing the command 
   in backticks)
